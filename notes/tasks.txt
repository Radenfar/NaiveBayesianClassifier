The report section should...
explain and motivate the chosen representation & data preprocessing,
explain the idea behind the model improvements and their implementation (including the implementation of the standard Naive Bayes)
explain the evaluation procedure (e.g., cross-validation or training/validation split)
include and explain the training/validation results for the standard and improved Naive Bayes model. You can summarize results using tables (or plots), but all results have to be explained descriptively as well.
be written in plain English and should not be longer than two A4 pages (export the notebook as pdf to see if the report section fits in two pages).
